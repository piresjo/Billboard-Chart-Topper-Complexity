# Billboard-Chart-Topper-Complexity
Going through all of the billboard charts and seeing how linguistically capable the singers are. This will need to be defined a bit better at a later date

Will require an api for billboard (to find out what songs actually made it to the top 100) and an api for genius (to get the lyrics)

TO-DO:
    - Set up API for Billboard (done)
    - Determine what measurements are being used to measure "linguistic complexity," then use NLTK to run the analyses
    - Possible - generate markov chain generator to (at least try to) recreate the artist's works
    - Possible - classifiers (mainly to relearn how to use python's ML stuff)
    - Generate a site to showcase all the findings (and potentially learn some JS stuff)
    - Maybe more? I don't know yet; this project is pretty open-ended
